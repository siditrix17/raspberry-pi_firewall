Having a stroong password, we can now go on and configure the network settings on our Raspberry Security System (RSS). We have to set a static IP address as well as the netmask and the gateway. The network topology is as follow : the LAN subnet is 192.168.1.0/24, the DSL modem/router is 192.168.1.1 (LAN gateway), and the RSS will be 192.168.1.3. Of course you can modify these settings accordingly to your network.

# vi /etc/rc.conf
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# NETWORKING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOSTNAME: Hostname of machine. Should also be put in /etc/hosts
#
HOSTNAME="RSS"
# Static IP
interface=eth0
address=192.168.1.3
netmask=255.255.255.0
broadcast=192.168.1.255
gateway=192.168.1.1

# Disable DHCP by commenting these lines or else it will override the static IP configuration
# interface=eth0
# address=
# netmask=
# gateway=

Remove from startup the unneeded daemons :
DAEMONS=(!hwclock syslog-ng network @crond @sshd @openntpd)

# vi /etc/hosts
192.168.1.3 PiWall
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
::1 localhost.localdomain localhost

# rc.d restart network

UPDATE :-


In this step we'll update the system and install required packages for the RSS

Initiate a full upgrade :
# pacman –Syu

Maybe the system asks to update pacman itself, if so answer with "yes".

Now we need to create keys for pacman :
# pacman-key –init

If you just wait for the process to finish, you will wait hours! The keys are generated with random factors and need external commands to speed up the process. If you have a mouse connected, you could move it around, or you just open another terminal (ALT + F2 or F3) and run different commands like ls -l, less, top, cat and so on.

After te keys are generated we now request a full upgrade again:
# pacman -Syu

This could take a while, makse some tea or coffee, pet your cat/dog, call a friend or read another chapter of a book. You won't miss anything awesome if you don't sit all the time in front of your TV or monitor.

Once it's done, we can now install the additional packages:
# pacman –S vim
# pacman –S htop
# pacman –S tcpdump

Vim is simply a lot better than vi, htop is an improved top, and tcpdump is very handy to debug network traffic and ensure that everything is routed correctly.

Now reboot the system to apply updates that requires it :
# reboot

Once the system has restarted, check the memory available :
# htop

If the total memory is down to 128Mo, that means that the "start.elf" is splitting 128MB for the OS and 128MB for the GPU. We do not need so much memory for the GPU, and we certainly need more for the system.

Fix it by doing the following to give 224MB to the OS :
# cd /boot
# mv ./start.elf ./start.elf.old
# cp ./arm224_start.elf ./start.elf
# reboot

RESIZING SD CARD :-  _------------------------------------

ArchLinux is now up to date and running, but the full SD card is not used. We need to extend the current partition to use the full space available.

# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0p2

Delete the partition :
d
2

Create a new one (new, primary, 2):
n
p
2
Enter
Enter

Write changes to disk :
w

Reboot to apply the changes :
# reboot

While the startup process, it will run a command to extend the partition, this will take a while depending on the size of your SD card

ADDING ANOTHER USER :--------------------------------------

It's no good idea to do everything as root. if this account gets compromized, we've got some serious problems. To avoid this we will now create a user who will not be root, but who will be allowed to run commands as root when needed.

We'll create now the user "rss", but feel free to create something better for you ;-)
# useradd -m -g users -G optical,storage,video,wheel,power -s /bin/bash rss

Create a password for our new account :
# passwd rss

Again you should really chose a strong password....

We then need to install the "sudo" package, which will enable our user to run commands as root when needed :
# pacman -S sudo

The last thing to allow us to use the sudo command :
# visudo
## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

Logout from root, and login with our new user :
# logout

From now on, your prompt will begin with "$" and not anymore with "#", and will require the sudo command for every privileged task.
